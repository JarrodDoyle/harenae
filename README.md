# Harenae

Harenae is my first attempt at a [falling sand game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-sand_game). I got as far as implementing some basic elements (Sand, Water, Stone, and Smoke). There's also some (bad) attempts at a multi-threaded chunk system in a separate branch. Currently working on a new version in Rust.
